[**Êó•Êú¨Ë™ûÁâà„ÅØ„Åì„Å°„Çâ**](https://github.com/beagleworks/metadata_eraser/blob/master/README_ja.md)

A privacy-focused web application that allows users to upload files and removes all metadata (EXIF, author information, location data, etc.) to return clean, private files.

## üåü Why Use Metadata Eraser?

Every file you create‚Äîwhether it's a photo, a PDF, or an Office document‚Äîcontains hidden information called metadata. This can include sensitive data like your location, the author's name, company details, and editing history. Sharing files without removing this metadata can lead to unintentional privacy leaks.

Metadata Eraser provides a simple and secure way to scrub this data from your files before you share them.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Multi-format Support**: Works with images (JPEG, PNG, TIFF), PDFs, and Microsoft Office documents (Word, Excel, PowerPoint).
-   **Privacy First**: No files are stored on the server. All processing is done in memory, and files are automatically deleted after processing.
-   **Batch Processing**: Upload and process multiple files at once, and download them as a convenient ZIP archive.
-   **User Control**: See a report of what metadata was removed and choose custom filenames for your cleaned files.
-   **Secure**: Implements file size limits (50MB) and secure validation to handle files safely.
